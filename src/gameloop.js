// 1.
// set up a new game
// create players and gameboards
// populate each gameboard with predetermined coordinates
// implement a system for allowing to place ships *later*

// 2.
// game loop should step through the game turn by turn
// using only methods from other objects
// if at any point i am tempted to write a new function inside the game loop
// step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to

// 3.
// create conditions so that the game ends once one player's ships have all been sunk
// this function is appropiate for the game modules
