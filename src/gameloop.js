// game loop should step through the game turn by turn
// using only methods from other objects
// if at any point i am tempted to write a new function inside the game loop
// step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to
function gameLoop() {
  // game preparation
  // place ships

  // start game
  // turn-based style, increment each turn
  // shots firing

  // game score
  // when all the ships of a player are sunk the other player wins

  // game ends
  // open module
  // restart / play again
}
